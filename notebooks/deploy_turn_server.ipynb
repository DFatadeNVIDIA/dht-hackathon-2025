    "# Deploying a TURN Server Using CoTURN\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to interact with our Tokkio Avatar, we'll need to set up a [media relay service](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/tokkio/5.0.0-beta/overview/components-and-microservices.html#media-relay-service). This component is responsible for relaying media between the client browser and the Tokkio backend. Especially when the client browser and the Tokkio backend cannot connect directly, they send data to an entity such as a TURN server, which then relays this data to the other device. \n",
    "\n",
    "This process ensures that communication can occur even if the direct connections are blocked for reasons such as when they are behind NAT or firewalls. The Tokkio deployment supports the options below as of today.\n",

    "- ReverseProxy service\n",
    "- Twilio\n",

    "In this notebook, we'll set up a [COTURN](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) service! COTURN is an open-source implementation of TURN and STUN server used for NAT traversal in WebRTC applications. It's expected that the COTURN server is set on a seperate CPU based (non-GPU enabled) virtual machine. Configuring a COTURN service or a TURN server in general on the same instance the Tokkio application is deployed on."
