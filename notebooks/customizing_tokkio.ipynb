    "# NVIDIA ACE Configurator:\n",
    "\n",
    "The ACE Configurator enables runtime configuration of Kubernetes applications via a VS Code extension, allowing users to quickly reconfigure microservices for workflows that require frequent changes-like adjusting LLM prompts, website styles, or animation parameters. It manages two types of configurations: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Kubernetes ConfigMaps for text-based settings and environment variables\n",
    "- Persistent Volumes for binary assets such as audio or 3D scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ace-configurator](../images/ace-configurator.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dual approach supports a wide range of configuration needs, from simple key-value pairs to large binary files. The ACE Configurator based developer workflow is designed to enable seamless debugging and streamlined iterative development for Tokkio Digital Human Agents. For more details regarding the ACE Configurator, please refer to the [ACE Configurator](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-configurator/1.0/index.html#ace-configurator-overview)\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow satisfies the following use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modify the agent pipeline during live deployment and instantly view the updated changes.\n",
    "- Changes remain persistent even after pod reboot.\n",
    "- No need to rebuild or redeploy the app for changes supported by the ACE Configurator.\n",

The extension is typically used in conjunction with the ACE Configurator microservice, so we'll be leveraging the configurator service we deployed as part of the original Tokkio pipeline, this can typically be accessed on port `30180` at `http://<application-instance-ip>:30180`. Please make sure the service is reachable from your local machine\n",

    "- The `OpenAILLMContext` fields can be updated as well. This will influence the prompt template that is used to interact with users. This can be changed to fit whatever use case you're looking for.\n",
    "- Finally, the `NvidiaRAGService` service parameters need to be updated. Update the `rag_server_url` to point to the instance you have Tokkio & NVIDIA RAG deployed on, by default, the service should default to port 8081, but if you have changed this in your deployment, please make sure the changes are reflected here.
